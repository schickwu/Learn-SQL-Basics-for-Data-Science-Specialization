# Learn-SQL-Basics-for-Data-Science
This Specialization is intended for a learner with no previous coding experience seeking to develop SQL query fluency. Through four progressively more difficult SQL projects with data science applications, you will cover topics such as SQL basics, data wrangling, SQL analysis, AB testing, distributed computing using Apache Spark, Delta Lake and more. These topics will prepare you to apply SQL creatively to analyze and explore data; demonstrate efficiency in writing queries; create data analysis datasets; conduct feature engineering, use SQL with other data analysis and machine learning toolsets; and use SQL with unstructured data sets. 
## Three course series
- SQL for Data Science
- Data Wrangling, Analysis and AB Testing with SQL
- Distributed Computing with Spark SQL
- SQL for Data Science Capstone Project

## What I've learned:

- Use SQL commands to filter, sort, & summarize data; manipulate strings, dates, & numerical data from different sources for analysis

- Assess and create datasets to solve your business questions and problems using SQL

- Use the collaborative Databricks workspace and create an end-to-end pipeline that reads data, transforms it, and saves the result

- Develop a project proposal & select your data, perform statistical analysis & develop metrics, and present your findings & make recommendations

## Final Capstone Project: 
This project is about analysing congressional tweets data from the USA to determine how tweets, politicians could affect the congress most, so as to understand legislative trends and develop better lobbying strategies. 
Audiences are companies like Lobbyist4America that try to help their customers who want to affect legislation by using effective lobbying strategy.
